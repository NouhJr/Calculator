It's just a simple calculator made with python based on Object-oriented programming concepts.

Consist of three main systems:

1-Basic Mathematical Operations.
which provides user with basic operatios like:add,subtract,...etc.
user can use these operations on two numbers or two vectors{one dimension array}

2-Basic Statistics Operations.
which provides user with basic operatios like:mean,median,...etc.

3-Basic Trigonometric Functions.
which provides user with basic trigonometric functions like:sine,cosine,...etc.
user can get the value of one of these functions or a visualized graph for specific angle and also can get a general visualized graphs for
sine,cosine,...etc.

it also provides user with simple interface which responds to user's actions like choosing between systems or when to close the program
which makes the program easy to use.
